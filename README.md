# Unexpected Route Matching in React Router DOM v6

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 related to unexpected route matching when using nested routes and parameters.  The issue arises when certain URL patterns are encountered, leading to incorrect component rendering.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that routes with parameters can sometimes unintentionally match against URLs they shouldn't. This leads to a mismatch between the intended route and the component actually displayed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the problematic URLs (e.g., `/users/123`, `/users/abc`). You'll see the `User` component render even when expecting other routes.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully structuring the routes to ensure the correct matching behavior.  Precise path definitions and the order of routes are key. Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
